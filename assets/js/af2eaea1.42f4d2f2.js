This is a question I have never asked myself before now.

The true answer is highly personal, and it will be very personal to each of you as each of you will need something different. There are many points that come to mind regarding my own personal experience. One of them that was extremely important to me and that I only came to learn later in life was to understand, respect and look after my body and mind. This means learning to sleep right, exercise right, eat right, work right, take care of my emotions \u2026 it sounds so simple and yet 19-year-old Ivana did not really know and learned all this hard way.
