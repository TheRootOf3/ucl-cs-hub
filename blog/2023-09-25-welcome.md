## Welcome to UCL CS!

Welcome to the UCL CS community! The academic year just kicked-off and you'll start your first programming classes soon! 🖥️

To help you deal with the unknown, we prepared this website as a good starting point to [set up your environment](docs/set-up-environment)!
Moreover, throughout the year you'll be supported by Programming Tutors, who will be there to help you understand programming concepts, and answer all your questions!

Keep in mind you're here not only to study, but also to explore and meet with others - there is so much to do at UCL and in London! 🎉

Good luck! 🥳
