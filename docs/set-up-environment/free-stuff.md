# 🎁 Free Stuff

> Get some _**free stuff**_ here!

Before going ahead and setting things up for your platform, get some free stuff online!

1. **GitHub Student Pack**.
   Head to [https://education.github.com/pack](https://education.github.com/pack) to get a GitHub Student Developer
   Pack. This will get you a free GitHub Pro account with unlimited private/public repos
   and give you access to a bunch of other free stuff like domain names, software, cloud hosting credits, and more
   while you’re a student. It also comes with [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot), and its VS Code extension! Cool, huh?

2. **JetBrains Student Pack**.
   Head to [https://www.jetbrains.com/student/](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/) to get all the JetBrains products for
   free while you're a student; you just need to renew every year and it takes a couple of minutes. You will need this to
   get the recommended programming tools in this guide.
