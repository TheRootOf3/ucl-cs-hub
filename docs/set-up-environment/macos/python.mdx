# Python 3

> Python is an experiment in how much freedom programmers need. Too much freedom and nobody can read another's code;
> too little and expressiveness is endangered. -- _Guido van Rossum_

We only use Python 3 at UCL because it‚Äôs 2023 and Python 2 is long lost in the past, thank goodness.

:::caution

Unlike Java JDK versions, **Python 2 and Python 3 are separate languages**! They differ in syntax and much more!

## Install Python

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="homebrew" label="Homebrew" default>

The simplest way to install Python 3 is to use Homebrew! Open Terminal and run the following command to install Python:

```bash
brew install python
```

Once it's completed (which may take some time!), let's test that Python has been installed correctly.

Type `python3` in Terminal. This should open interactive shell, where you can type...

```python
print("Hello World!")
```

...and expect a kind greeting from your very own Python! Congratulations! üêç üéâ

:::tip

You can close Python's interactive shell by pressing `Ctrl`+`D` or typing `exit()`.

:::tip

Although not necessary for using Python,
you may find it helpful to install the standard GUI library - `tkinter`:

```bash
brew install python-tk
```

## Set up your IDE

<Tabs>

VS Code is a highly customizable code editor, which has fantastic extensions! Install the official support for Python, which provides you with great code completion, code formatter, framework for testing, debugging, and more!

PyCharm is a powerful IDE, with lots of useful built-in tools! Assuming you've already got your JetBrains Toolbox (if not, [check this out!](/docs/set-up-environment/macos#jetbrains-toolbox)):

1. Open the JetBrains Toolbox and install PyCharm Professional, once opened it should automatically find your Python environment.
