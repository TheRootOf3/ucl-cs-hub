# The C Programming Language

> C has the power of assembly language and the convenience of â€¦ assembly language. -- _Dennis Ritchie_

Mac already has gcc (the compiler we need for C) and debugging tools installed for C so we just need to setup the IDE.

## Configure your IDE

:::tip

While you can probably survive your C class without touching Terminal, **we recommend using it**!
It not only gives you a better understanding of how a computer program is created, but also **prepares you for your further modules, which almost certainly will require familiarity with the shell**.

**Let's use VS Code to create a simple C program!**

1. Open VS Code and create an empty file called `main.c`. This will be our C code source file. Such files have the `.c` extension!
2. Paste the following snippet and save the file:

   ```c
   #include <stdio.h>

   int main() {
       printf("Hello, World!\n");
       return 0;
   }
   ```

3. Now, you need to _compile_ your code. Let's see how we can do it from Terminal. Open Terminal in the same directory as the `main.c` file and run the following command:
   `bash
gcc -o main_executable main.c
`
   This command will invoke `gcc` - compiler of the C code, compile the file called `main.c` and output a binary file named `main_executable`.
4. To run your program, simply type:

   ```bash
   ./main_executable
   ```

   which should produce

   ```bash
   > Hello, World!
   ```

Well done, _Terminal_ is for _Turbo_ cool people! ðŸŽ‰ ðŸ¥³

<TabItem value="jetbrains-clion" label="JetBrains CLion">

### Installation

1. Open the Jetbrains Toolbox and install [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/).

2. Press `New Project`, select C executable from the new project screen with any language standard.
   A simple Hello World program should open and if you click the play symbol at the top right it will compile and execute in a terminal at the bottom of the screen.

   ```c
    #include <stdio.h>

    int main() {
        printf("Hello, World!\n");
        return 0;
    }
   ```

### Additional Notes

1. CLion uses CMake to configure running your project. While others are worrying about linking new files to their project
   you can simply add it to the `add_executable` section (as shown with `new_file.c` below).

   ```c
   cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.16)
   project(untitled C)

   set(CMAKE_C_STANDARD 99)

   add_executable(untitled main.c new_file.c)
   ```

2. If you ever need to pipe something from C to another program (such as a turtle program) then you can compile your
   application with CLion (hammer icon) and then run your program in terminal with a pipe operator.

   ```bash
   > .\your_program | turtle
   ```

3. If you ever need to access `gcc` directly then you can access it via your terminal.
