To develop with Java you need both a JDK (Java Development Kit) and an IDE.

## Install Java

Download the latest version of the [Java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/), making sure to accept the user agreement and installing it.

:::tip Note on open-source OpenJDK

Some student may prefer to use OpenJDK, which is an open-source "alternative" to Oracle's JDK (in fact, nowadays Oracle JDK is based on top of OpenJDK, while both are maintained by Oracle). Using OpenJDK will not change your learning or development experience, however, we recommend consulting this choice with a module leader.

## Set up your IDE

It is possible to develop Java programs in VS Code and some student prefer to use it (it has a great Java extension pack as well!).

Nevertheless, most students find it **very intuitive to use IntelliJ IDEA from JetBrains**. IntelliJ is a great tool - it comes with *everything* you may need. Literally, everything.


To get IntelliJ IDEA, open the JetBrains Toolbox and install IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate. Once opened, it should automatically find your Java environment.
