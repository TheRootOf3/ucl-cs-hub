## Install Haskell

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="homebrew" label="Homebrew" default>

Paste the following command to your Terminal window:

```bash
brew install ghc cabal-install haskell-stack haskell-language-server
```

This make take a while to install all necessary Haskell components. Once finished, let's test your installation:

1. Type `ghci` in terminal. This will open Prelude - Haskell's interactive shell.
2. Type `2022 + 1` and hit `Enter`.
3. Enjoy Haskell telling you the current year! _Woooah!_ ðŸ¥³

:::tip

To close Prelude, simply hit `Ctrl`+`D`. Just like in Python!

<TabItem value="ghcup" label="GHCup (officially supported)">

We need to install GHCup, which includes all necessary components to execute Haskell code.
Run the following command in a Terminal window:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://get-ghcup.haskell.org | sh
```

Once you see the message "Welcome to Haskell!", you'll be prompted about updating your `$PATH` variable, installing HLS and better integration with GHCup. Please choose all the default values:
![haskell start installation](/gif/haskell_start.gif)

The download and installation may take a couple of minutes. Once all components are installed, test your Haskell by launching its interactive shell with `ghci` and typing `1 + 1`:
![haskell test](/gif/haskell_end.gif)

## Get VS Code extension

JetBrains do not have an IDE for Haskell,
but VS Code works very well with the **official Haskell extension**!

Cool! You're all set to start your journey with functional programming.
Psst... There is a pretty good online guide to Haskell: [Learn You A Haskell for Great Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) ðŸ“š
