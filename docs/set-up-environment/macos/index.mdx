# üçé MacOS Getting Started

You have it slightly easier than the ü™ü Windows users, but there's still some work to do! Luckily for you people,
a lot of the work is done for you and doesn't require typing much.

## Step 1: Homebrew and Developer Tools

### Homebrew

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh) will change and/or save your life as a Mac developer. It will also install the C compiler,
amongst many other bits and pieces that will be super useful. So let's do it!

Open a Terminal window, you can find it in /Applications/Utilities or press `Cmd`+`Space` and search for "terminal".
Once you have your Terminal window open, paste the following command in, all on one line.
Enter your password when it asks you to:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

:::tip

When you're typing in your password, you won't actually see it being typed (not even the asterisks!) üëª.
Don't worry and just type your password and press Enter at the end. If you got it wrong, the Terminal will ask
you to try again!

:::

Once installed, you may see some extra updates for the macOS Developer Tools in the Mac App Store. Go ahead and
install those.

## Step 2: Set up your IDE

### Visual Studio Code

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is a great code editor, with a huge community and a number of useful extensions!
It works out of the box, with the support for syntax highlighting, debugging, git and many more!

**You can download it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com)** or use homebrew:

```bash
brew install --cask visual-studio-code
```

Sometimes, it is convenient to run VS Code from your terminal. Let's say you have a simple project in a directory called `hello-world/`.
You can open it in VS Code just like this:

```bash
code hello-world/
```

To make sure your shell understands what to do with the `code` keyword, you should ensure your VS Code is added to the `$PATH` environmental variable!
Authors of VS Code made it really simple, and you can add VS Code to `$PATH` with the following steps:

1. Open _VS Code_.
2. Open the editor commands window by pressing `Shift`+`Cmd`+`P`.
3. Type `Shell command PATH`, and select `Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH`.
4. Authorize with your password, if prompted to do so.
5. Voil√†! Now, test it as follows.

   - Navigate to the home directory:

     ```bash
     cd ~
     ```

   - Open VS Code in the home directory

     ```bash
     code .
     ```

   :::note

   The dot symbol `.` represents your current directory, so you're essentially telling your terminal to run `code` "here"! _Cool, huh?_

### Jetbrains Toolbox

The tools you use can transform development from being a chore to a joy. Having a consistent environment across all
languages has advantages. Jetbrains tools are free for students, and they offer advanced IntelliSense (auto code completion) capabilities.

1. If you have not already, sign-up for the [Jetbrains Student Pack](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/).

- If you already have GitHub Student Developer Pack, you should be able to authorize with it.
- Otherwise, use your UCL email address!

2. Download the [Toolbox App](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/) and sign in with your account. This will
   automatically license any Jetbrains tools on your system.

## Step 3: Git

[Git](https://git-scm.com) is a **really powerful tool** ‚ö°Ô∏è! It is an example of Version Control Software (VCS),
which essentially is a time machine allowing you to track changes, go back in time (when needed!) and collaborate efficiently with fellow developers.
It's a **true life-saver**, when after removing some useless-looking piece of code,
it turns out to be critical 3 days later. With git, you can just look it up and revert\*!

Git should already be installed, and you can verify that with:

```bash
git --version
```

If not installed you can install with Homebrew:

```bash
brew install git
```

You can then configure your username and email:

```bash
git config --global user.name "YourUsername"
git config --global user.email "YourEmail"
```

To find your GitHub email address you can go here: https://github.com/settings/emails.

\*_when used properly, LOL_

:::tip

You will be using `git` and GitHub in several modules and courseworks.
There are multiple ways of interacting with GitHub. You can use:

- [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/),
- Git/GitHub extension to your IDE,
- `git` command line interface.

We **recommend** trying the command line interface. There is a range of useful tutorials:

- How Git works https://www.atlassian.com/git
- Official Git Tutorial https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial
- Learn Git Branching (_really cool!_) https://learngitbranching.js.org/

To make this as smooth as possible, you may want to [read how to use Secure Shell (SSH)](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh) to connect to GitHub!
