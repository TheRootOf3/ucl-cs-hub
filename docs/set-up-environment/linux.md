# üêß Linux Getting Started

> Here's your joke, go ahead and compile it yourself

If you use üêß Linux as your daily driver, we are going to (possibly) naively assume you‚Äôre pretty good with it already.
However, if you need any assistance, we will do whatever we can to help!

To get going with Linux, you‚Äôll need the following packages installed:

- `build-essential`, or your distribution‚Äôs equivalent metapackage to install `gcc` and any associated tools.

- `python3` and `python3-pip`, or your distribution‚Äôs equivalent package(s) to get the latest version of Python 3 and
  Pip

- `python3-virtualenv`, or your distribution‚Äôs Python 3 virtual environment package

- GHCup to install Haskell components. More about this [here](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/).

- The latest version of the JDK (Java Development Kit). Either you can download it from Oracle directly or you can use an
  installation package. This differs from platform to platform, but for Ubuntu we recommend installing Open-JDK using this
  tutorial https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-java-with-apt-on-ubuntu-22-04.

- JetBrains [IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=linux), you can activate it
  using the student membership we mentioned at the beginning of this guide.

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is a fairly lightweight code editor available on a range of platforms!

:::tip

To test your setup, you can use any of the examples under the [üçé MacOS](/docs/set-up-environment/macos) or [ü™ü Windows](/docs/set-up-environment/windows) guides.
