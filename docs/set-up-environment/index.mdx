# 🛠️ Set Up Your Environment

## Getting Started

Welcome! To make your life easier (at least in the beginning!) we aim to provide minimal but comprehensive set up your environment guide!

We recommend you start by getting some [🎁 Free Stuff](/docs/set-up-environment/free-stuff), and then configuring your platform:

- [🪟 Windows](/docs/set-up-environment/windows)
- [🍎 MacOS](/docs/set-up-environment/macos)
- [🐧 Linux](/docs/set-up-environment/linux)

Now, let's get your environment set up! 🎉
