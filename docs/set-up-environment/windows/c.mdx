# The C Programming Language

> C has the power of assembly language and the convenience of â€¦ assembly language. -- _Dennis Ritchie_

C on Windows is not the best experience but virtualizing UNIX is not the solution.

## Install Cygwin

Cygwin is an extensive collection of GNU and open-source tools that give access to Linux-like functionality on Windows. One of these tools, `gcc`, is the de facto compiler for C, which you will need during your degree.

You can either install Cygwin [here](https://cygwin.com/install.html) or use winget:

```powershell
winget install -e --id Cygwin.Cygwin
```

When installing Cygwin you will need to select
`gcc-g++`, `cmake`, `make`, and `gdb` from the packages list.

<summary> Let's test your installation!</summary>

Type `gcc` in your shell. You should receive an `error: no input files` message.

If _not_, then follow the below instructions:

1. Go to the `cygwin` folder in your Files application.
2. Copy the complete path to the `cygwin/bin` directory.
3. Right-click "This PC" on the left sidebar.
4. Select Properties > Advanced > Environment Variables.
5. Navigate towards the PATH variable in System variables, click "Edit".
6. Click "New", and paste the copied `cygwin/bin` directory path.

Restart your shell or restart your computer for the changes to take effect.

## Configure your IDE

:::tip

While you can probably survive your C class without touching Terminal, **we recommend using it**!
It not only gives you a better understanding of how a computer program is created, but also **prepares you for your further modules, which almost certainly will require familiarity with the shell**.

**Let's use VS Code to create a simple C program!**

1. Open VS Code and create an empty file called `main.c`. This will be our C code source file. Such files have the `.c` extension!
2. Enable language support for C by installing the C/C++ Microsoft extension.

![C/C++ Microsoft extension](/img/c_extension.png)

3. Paste the following snippet and save the file:

   ```c
   #include <stdio.h>

   int main() {
       printf("Hello, World!\n");
       return 0;
   }
   ```

4. Now, you need to _compile_[^1] your code. Let's see how we can do it from PowerShell (or VS Code's built-in shell). Open PowerShell in the same directory as the `main.c` file and run the following command:

```powershell
gcc -o main_executable main.c
```

This command will invoke `gcc` - compiler of the C code, compile the file called `main.c` and output a binary file named `main_executable`. 5. To run your program, simply type:

```powershell
./main_executable
```

which should produce

```powershell
> Hello, World!
```

Well done! ðŸŽ‰ ðŸ¥³

<TabItem value="jetbrains-clion" label="JetBrains CLion">

**Nevermind, let's use CLion instead!**

1. Open the Jetbrains Toolbox and install [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/)

2. Open CLion, click configure and then open `Toolchains` under `Build, Execution, Deployment`. Click the small plus
   button and select Cygwin, if your environment is not found automatically select the dropdown and find the root of
   your cygwin install. Ensure that CMake, Make, C Compiler, and Debugger are all found (either detected or a
   small tick mark).

![CLion Toolchain!](/img/windows-c-toolchain.png)

3. Click OK, and then press `New Project`, select C executable from the new project screen with any language standard.
   A simple Hello World program should open and if you click the play symbol at the top right it will compile and execute
   in a terminal at the bottom of the screen.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
return 0;
}
```

![CLion Toolchain!](/img/windows-c-run.png)

:::note
CLion uses [CMake](https://cmake.org) to configure running your project. While others are worrying about linking new files to their project, you can simply add it to the `add_executable` section (as shown with `new_file.c` below).

```c
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.16)
project(untitled C)

set(CMAKE_C_STANDARD 99)

add_executable(untitled main.c new_file.c)
```

## Additional Notes

1. If you ever need to pipe something from C to another program (such as a turtle program) then you can compile your
   application and then run your executable in PowerShell Core with a pipe operator.

```powershell
.\your_program.exe | turtle.exe
```

2. If you ever need to access `gcc` directly then you can open the installed `Cygwin Terminal`.

3. If compiling with Cygwin via the terminal results in an access denied message you can try disabling your real-time anti-virus scanning.

:::caution
Certain courseworks in C require that the code be compilable on UNIX systems (MacOS, Linux etc.), which Windows is not. As such, it is strongly recommended you test your code on a UNIX machine to ensure that your code functions on both machines. To access a Linux instance, you can either use virtualization, [multi-booting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-booting)[^2], or use the [UCL CS lab machines](/docs/labs-availability) (recommended).
