## Install Haskell

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="winget" label="Winget" default>

Simply run the following command in PowerShell:

```powershell
winget install -e --id commercialhaskell.stack
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="ghcup" label="GHCup (officially supported)">

Haskell recently changed the recommended installation method to installing GHCup. These instructions are based off
[https://www.haskell.org/downloads/](https://www.haskell.org/downloads/).

1. Install GHC, cabal-install, stack and haskell-language-server via GHCup with the script below:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force;[System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072;Invoke-Command -ScriptBlock ([ScriptBlock]::Create((Invoke-WebRequest https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/sh/bootstrap-haskell.ps1 -UseBasicParsing))) -ArgumentList $true
```

There's also a [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB4fmQiUYPw) explaining installation on Windows.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<summary> Let's test your installation!</summary>

1. Type `ghci` in PowerShell. This will open Prelude - Haskell's interactive shell.
2. Type `2022 + 1` and hit `Enter`.
3. Enjoy Haskell telling you the current year! _Woooah!_ ðŸ¥³

## Get the VS Code extension

JetBrains do not have an IDE for Haskell,
but VS Code works very well with the **official Haskell extension**!

Cool! You're all set to start your journey with functional programming.
Psst... There is a pretty good online guide to Haskell: [Learn You A Haskell for Great Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) ðŸ“š
