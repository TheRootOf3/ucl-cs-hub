# ðŸªŸ Windows Getting Started

Windows has changed significantly in the last few years. It may have been recommended to try and emulate [UNIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) either
with virtualization products[^1] or WSL[^2]. This is not required, and you are likely to face development difficulties when you start crafting more complex applications (especially with debugging).

:::tip
Note that this guide is primarily designed for Windows 11. Although Windows 10 is still perfectly functional, it is strongly recommended you upgrade if possible.
:::

## Step 1: Powershell Core and Winget

### PowerShell Core

One of the biggest reasons Windows used to be so horrible to develop on was that you were either stuck with [Command Prompt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cmd.exe) (which is somehow still backwards compatible with scripts from Windows-95) or [Windows PowerShell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerShell). PowerShell was not terrible it was
just annoying and completely different to any other command line interface you might end up using. Now we have
PowerShell Core, a complete rewriting of PowerShell to make it easier to use and more [bash](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)>) like.

1. Download the latest release of
   [PowerShell Core](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell) for your system, it is likely you have a 64-bit machine
   (and it is Windows) so PowerShell-7.2.6-win-x64.msi should work nicely (you should use win-x86.msi if your
   machine is 32-bit[^3]).

2. Run the msi file and install.

3. You probably just opened PowerShell 7 and think it looks rather dated for a brand-new command line. This is where
   [Windows Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9N0DX20HK701) comes in, a Microsoft Store app to update
   that old look.

4. Open Windows Terminal and click the dropdown and select the updated PowerShell. If the updated PowerShell is not
   the default shell you can click on Settings and change the `defaultProfile` to be the GUID with the source of:
   `Windows.Terminal.PowershellCore`.

5. Test your shell with the following command. If it fails, then it is likely you are running Command Prompt or the old
   Windows PowerShell.

```powershell
(Test-Path ~) ? "Everything works!" : "Everything also works, but somehow you don't have a user directory!"
```

### Winget

Microsoft is a great company, but seemingly incapable at advertising actual _useful_ tools. Unbeknownst to most, like Mac, Windows has its own package manager, Winget. Using this'll make your life much easier when it comes to installing developer tools.

:::tip
Winget only works for Windows 10 and later, which is why you should make sure you upgrade!
:::

It comes by default with the Microsoft App Installer, which you can get on the [Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/app-installer/9NBLGGH4NNS1) for free! If you already have it, ensure it's the latest version.

## Step 2: Set up your IDE[^4]

### Jetbrains Toolbox

The tools you use can transform development from being a chore to a joy. Having a consistent environment across all
languages is key. Throughout this guide we will be using the free (for students) Jetbrains tools, they have by
far the most advanced IntelliSense[^5] capabilities, although sadly there is no tool for Haskell.

1. If you have not already, sign-up for the [Jetbrains Student Pack](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/).

2. Download the [Toolbox App](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/) and sign in with your account. This will
   automatically license any Jetbrains tools on your system.

### Visual Studio Code[^6]

Jetbrains's tools are great, but they're equally heavy. This is where the lightweight [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) comes in. It's a fantastic code editor, with a huge community and a number of useful extensions.
It works out of the box, with the support for syntax highlighting, debugging, git and many more!

**You can download it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com)** or use winget:

```powershell
winget install -e --id Microsoft.VisualStudioCode
```

<details>
  <summary>See how to run VS Code directly from Terminal!</summary>
  <div>
    <div>

Sometimes, it is convenient to run VS Code from your terminal. Let's say you have a simple project in a directory called `hello-world/`.
You can open it in VS Code just like this:

```powershell
code hello-world/
```

To make sure your shell understands what to do with the `code` keyword, you should ensure your VS Code is added to the `$PATH` environmental variable!
Authors of VS Code made it really simple, and you can add VS Code to `$PATH` with the following steps:

1. Open _VS Code_.
2. Open the editor commands window by pressing `Shift`+`Cmd`+`P`.
3. Type `Shell command PATH`, and select `Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH`.
4. Authorize with your password, if prompted to do so.
5. VoilÃ ! Now, test it as follows.

   - Navigate to the home directory:

     ```powershell
     cd ~
     ```

   - Open VS Code in the home directory

     ```powershell
     code .
     ```

   :::note

   The dot symbol `.` represents your current directory, so you're essentially telling your terminal to run `code` "here"! _Cool, huh?_

## Step 3: Git

Download and install git using the following command:

```powershell
winget install -e --id Git.Git
```

Alternatively, install it from [here](https://git-scm.com/download/win).

You then need to configure git with the commands below.
To find your
[github email address](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/setting-your-commit-email-address)
you can go here: https://github.com/settings/emails.

```powershell
git config --global user.name "YourUsername"
git config --global user.email "YourEmail"
```

:::tip

You will be using `git` and GitHub in several modules and courseworks.
There are multiple ways of interacting with GitHub. You can use:

- [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/),
- Git/GitHub extension to your IDE,
- `git` command line interface.

We **recommend** trying the command line interface. There is a range of useful tutorials:

- How Git works https://www.atlassian.com/git
- Official Git Tutorial https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial
- Learn Git Branching (_really cool!_) https://learngitbranching.js.org/

To make this as smooth as possible, you may want to [read how to use Secure Shell (SSH)](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh) to connect to GitHub!

## Additional Notes

### Environment Variables

To run an application in PowerShell you either need to know the full location of that executable
(such as: `& "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-12.0.2\bin\java.exe" -version` where the `&` just informs
PowerShell that the following string points to an executable). Or it needs to be on the `PATH`[^7]; if
`C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-12.0.2\bin\` is on the `PATH` then you can simply type `java -version`.
So how do you add programs to the `PATH`? Well first you should consider that you might not want to add everything to the
`PATH`; only folders which you think you will need to use from the command line.

To add a folder to the `PATH` search for Environment Variable in the start menu, the first option should open
System Properties. Click on Environment Variables at the bottom right; at the top you can see all the user
variables. We are interested in the Path Variable so select it and click Edit. To add a new folder to the
`PATH` click New (top right) and write the full folder name. There is also a `PATH` variable under system variables
(the bottom box) which applies to all users however you should mainly use the `PATH` under user variables.

### Unix Emulation

Windows Subsystem for Linux (or WSL) lets you run Linux software and a full Linux command line from within Windows
without having to reboot or run a Virtual Machine. You can also access all your Windows files from WSL without
having to do any magic or hackery. If you need this functionality a good guide can be found here:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10.
