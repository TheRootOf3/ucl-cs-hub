# Python 3

> Python is an experiment in how much freedom programmers need. Too much freedom and nobody can read another's code;
> too little and expressiveness is endangered. -- _Guido van Rossum_

We only use Python 3 at UCL because it‚Äôs 2023 and Python 2 is long lost in the past, thank goodness.

:::caution

Unlike Java JDK versions, **Python 2 and Python 3 are separate languages**! They differ in syntax and much more! Therefore, keep in mind that whenever Python is mentioned, it is implied to be Python 3.
